# Braille-Art

A web page to easily create and transform braille pictures. Braille Art can be created by providing any BTTV, FFZ, global or Twitch Channel emote or a custom image.
<br>

## Usage
When generating with the checkbox ticked, blank braille characters "⠀" (__not spaces__) will be replaced with "⠄" (__not a dot but a single braille character__).

The rest of the controls should be self explanatory.

<br>

## Code
Parts of the functionality are achieved through a javascript implementation of the [PyBrailleArt](https://github.com/VJ-Duardo/PyBrailleArt) library.
