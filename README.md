# Transform-Braille-Art

A web page to easily transform braille art/pictures. Functions include __rotating__, __inverting__ and __mirroring__.

<br>

## Usage
When transforming with the checkbox ticked, blank braille characters "⠀" (__not spaces__) will be replaced with "⠄" (__not a dot but a single braille character__).

The rest of the controls should be self explanatory.

<br>

## Code
The functionality is achieved through a javascript implementation of the [PyBrailleArt](https://github.com/VJ-Duardo/PyBrailleArt) library.
